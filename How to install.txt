Hello there!
If you are reading this, then you are looking at the project of Group 4. Before you proceed, please know that we tried to do our best with the time we are given, and we thank you for the oppurtunity you gave us to familiarize ourselves with various web tools, frameworks, libraries and programming languages and help us become better developers. We all feel that we improved a lot thanks to the project, so thank you again.

How to install:

- First, you must install VSCode.
- Then, in the VSCode terminal, if you don't have NodeJS, you should install it from its website. You can download the latest version from here: https://nodejs.org/en/download/ To see that it is installed correctly in your machine, you can open the Linux terminal or Microsoft Powershell and type node --version and npm --version.
- After that, open VSCode and enter the terminal. You can do this by clicking the button on the top that says Terminal and then click New Terminal from the options.
- After opening the terminal, type npx create-react-app my-app to the terminal. (My-app is the name of your app and can be anything, it doesn't matter.)
- Next thing you wanna do is type npm install to the terminal so that the Node.js package manager is installed. This should create a large folder called node-modules in your app.
- Then, you wanna install papaparse. Type the npm install papaparse command in the app so that it is installed.
- After that, there should be public and src files in the app you created. You should change those folders with the same named folders in this zip file, or you can manually add the files to those folders yourself. Unfortunately, we couldn't send you the full project file because it's size is too large. Sorry.
- After that, you should type cd my-app to the terminal and then type {npm start} to the terminal, without the curly brackets and voila! Your app should start.
